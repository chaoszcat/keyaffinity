I was browsing FurAffinity the other day, and it occurred to me that there was no perfect way to browse through a user’s gallery. I was also browsing Tumblr around the same time, and I was using the J/K scrolling along with Missing e’s extra shortcuts (such as L for like and R for reblog). This inspired me to create a similar solution for FurAffinity. A couple days later, **KeyAffinity** was finally born.

This simple script is a Chrome Extension that allows you to browse FurAffinity with ease. A list of the shortcuts available for use is available below. **KeyAffinity** is available for free on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyaffinity/jijefnemlojbcmplfaiklanbbcpeacaa?hl=en-US).
